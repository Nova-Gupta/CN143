			<h2>Chicken Parmesan</h2>
			<p>Ingredients: 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, 1 cup all-purpose flour, 2 large eggs, 2 cups breadcrumbs, 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese, 2 cups marinara sauce, 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, Salt and pepper, 2 tbsp olive oil.</p>
			<p>Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400°F. Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Dredge the chicken in flour, shaking off any excess. Beat the eggs in a shallow dish. In another dish, combine the breadcrumbs and Parmesan cheese. Dip each chicken breast in the egg mixture, then coat in the breadcrumb mixture. Heat the olive oil in a large oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook until golden brown, about 3-4 minutes per side. Pour the marinara sauce over the chicken and top with mozzarella cheese. Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake until the cheese is melted and bubbly, about 15-20 minutes. Serve with pasta or crusty bread.</p>

			<h2>Best-Ever Beef Ragu</h2>
			<p>Ingredients: 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, 1 cup all-purpose flour, 2 large eggs, 2 cups breadcrumbs, 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese, 2 cups marinara sauce, 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, Salt and pepper, 2 tbsp olive oil.
            </p>
			<p>Directions
                Step 1
                In a large stock pot over medium heat, heat 1 tablespoon oil. Season chuck roast with salt and pepper and sear, in batches if needed, until browned on all sides, 10 minutes. Remove into a large bowl.
                Step 2
                Heat remaining oil, still over medium heat. Add onion and cook until soft, 6 minutes. Add garlic, fennel seeds, and red pepper flakes and cook until fragrant, 1 minute more.
                Step 3
                Add tomato paste and cook until it is darkened in color, 1 to 2 minutes more. Deglaze pot with wine, scraping any brown bits up at the bottom of your pot with a wooden spoon.
                Step 4
                Add whole peeled tomatoes, water, thyme, bay leaf, balsamic vinegar, and seared pot roast and season with salt and pepper. Stir to combine and reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, until meat easily shreds, 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Use a wooden spoon to break up tomatoes and meat, and remove bay leaf. Serve over your favorite pasta or polenta. Top with parmesan and parsley before serving.</p>

			<h2>Chicken Piccata</h2>
			<p>Ingredients
                bookmarksSAVE TO MY RECIPES
                3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
                Kosher salt
                Freshly ground black pepper
                1/4 c. (30 g.) all-purpose flour
                1/2 c. extra-virgin olive oil, divided
                6 tbsp. cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces
                1/2 c. dry white wine
                1/2 c. low-sodium chicken broth
                Juice of 1 lemon
                1 (3.5-oz.) jar capers, rinsed
                Lemon wedges, for serving</p>
            <p>Directions
                Step 1
                Cut chicken breasts in half parallel to work surface all the way through. In between 2 sheets of plastic wrap, pound each breast until 1/4" thick; generously season with salt and pepper.
                Step 2
                In a large shallow bowl, place flour. Dredge chicken in flour, shaking off excess. In a large skillet over high heat, heat 1/4 cup oil until very hot. Working with 3 chicken pieces at a time, cook, turning once, until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate. Adjust heat as needed and repeat with remaining chicken.
                Step 3
                In same skillet over high heat, bring wine, broth, and lemon juice to a boil. Cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened and reduced by about one-quarter, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and add butter, one piece at a time, vigorously whisking after each addition; don’t stop whisking until all butter is incorporated. If sauce starts to break, add 1 tablespoon water and continue to whisk until sauce is smooth and glossy.
                Step 4
                Return chicken to skillet. Add capers, bring sauce to a light simmer, and cook until warmed through, about 3 minutes. Serve with lemon wedges alongside.</p>

			<h2>Skillet Eggplant Parm</h2>
            <p>Ingredients
                bookmarksSAVE TO MY RECIPES
                3/4 c. plus 2 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil
                2 medium eggplants (about 1¾ lb. total), sliced ½" thick
                Kosher salt
                Freshly ground black pepper
                1 1/2 c. marinara sauce
                1 1/2 c. (6 oz.) shredded mozarella
                3/4 c. (3 oz.) shredded Parmesan
                1/4 c. packed fresh basil leaves, plus more for garnish
                3/4 c. panko bread crumbs</p>
            <p>Directions
                Step 1
                Preheat oven to 400°. Heat ¼ cup oil in a large, oven-safe skillet (about 12") over medium high. 
                Step 2
                Working in three batches, add eggplant in a single layer and season with salt and pepper. Cook until golden brown on both sides, flipping halfway through, about 4 minutes per side (you may need to adjust the heat between medium and medium-high as you go). Transfer to a plate. Repeat with remaining eggplant, using ¼ cup oil per batch as needed. Remove skillet from heat.
                Step 3
                Add 1 cup marinara to the skillet, scraping up any bits stuck to the bottom. Arrange half the eggplant in a single layer and top with half the mozzarella and ¼ cup Parmesan. Top with remaining eggplant, dollop with remaining ½ cup marinara, and top with remaining ½ cup mozzarella, ¼ cup Parmesan, and basil leaves.
                Step 4
                In a small bowl, mix panko and remaining ¼ cup Parmesan with remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Season with salt and pepper and over top skillet. Bake until bubbling and breadcrumbs are golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Serve hot with more fresh basil leaves, if you like.</p>

			<h2>White Pizza</h2>
            <p>Ingredients
                bookmarksSAVE TO MY RECIPES
                1 lb. pizza dough, divided in half
                Vegetable oil, for brushing
                Coarse cornmeal, for sprinkling
                1/4 c. extra-virgin olive oil
                4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
                1 1/2 c. ricotta
                1/2 tsp. kosher salt
                1/2 tsp. freshly ground black pepper
                1 tbsp. freshly chopped oregano
                1 tsp. freshly chopped thyme
                2 c. shredded mozzarella, divided</p>
            <p>Directions
                Step 1
                Preheat oven to 500°. Brush two large baking sheets with vegetable oil and sprinkle each with a layer of cornmeal. 
                Step 2
                In a small sauce pan over medium-low heat, heat olive oil. Add garlic and stir until lightly golden, then immediately remove from heat. Strain garlic and season with a pinch of salt. Reserve oil, and set both aside. 
                Step 3
                In a small bowl, mix together ricotta, salt, pepper, and half the herbs. 
                Step 4
                On a lightly floured surface, shape each half of pizza dough into a round ball, then press down the center of each to create a 1/2" crust. With the dough resting on the back of your hands and your knuckles, gently stretch dough out with the help of gravity by moving your hands inch by inch along the crust. Transfer to prepared baking sheets. 
                Step 5
                Brush each pizza dough all over with reserved garlic oil. Sprinkle each pie with 1 cup mozzarella and 2 tablespoons pecorino, then dollop 3/4 cup of ricotta mixture on each pizza. 
                Step 6
                Bake pizzas until crust is golden and cheese is melty, 15 to 17 minutes. 
                Step 7
                Garnish with remaining herbs, reserved garlic chips, and red pepper flakes before slicing and serving.</p>
