			<h2>Recipe 1: Soup dumplings Recipe</h2>
            <h3>Broth</h3>
            <p>
                In a medium pot over medium-high heat, bring broth, soy sauce, ginger, and garlic to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until reduced to about 1 cup, about 10 minutes. Discard ginger and garlic. Add gelatin and whisk to incorporate. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Pour broth into a shallow pan and refrigerate at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour.
            </p>
            <h3>Wrappers</h3>
            <p>
                In the large bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, beat flour and water on medium speed until dough is soft and smooth in texture, 5 to 10 minutes (you can also do this by hand). Wrap dough with a thin damp cloth or plastic wrap and let rest at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour at room temperature.
            </p>
            <p>
                Line a sheet tray with parchment, then dust with flour. Cut dough into 4 pieces. Roll each piece to about 1/16" thick, then cut into 4" rounds. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Transfer rounds to prepared tray. Cover with a damp towel to prevent drying out.

			<h2>Recipe 2: Orange chicken</h2>
            <p>
                In a shallow bowl, beat eggs until blended. In another shallow bowl, mix flour and 1/2 cup cornstarch; season with salt and black pepper. Coat chicken in egg, then toss in flour mixture, tapping off any excess.            </p>
            <p>
                Into a large, deep skillet, pour oil to a depth of 1/4". Heat until shimmering and a piece of chicken sizzles when added. Working in batches, fry chicken until golden brown and crispy, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate.            </p>
            <p>
                In a medium saucepan over medium heat, heat 1 tablespoon oil. Add garlic, ginger, and red pepper and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Whisk in orange juice, hoisin sauce, soy sauce, chili sauce, vinegar, brown sugar, and lemon juice and bring to a simmer.            </p>
            <p>
                Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk remaining 1 tablespoon cornstarch with 2 tablespoons water. Slowly whisk into sauce to thicken and simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce is syrupy, about 5 minutes.            </p>
            <p>
                Transfer chicken to a platter. Add sauce, toss to combine, and top with scallions. Serve over rice.
